                                RELEVANCE CHECKER

The project "Relevance Checker" aims to develop a web application that leverages OpenAI's
GPT API to assess the relevance between a given tweet and its corresponding reply. The
application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a tweet and its reply,
triggering a backend process that queries the OpenAI GPT engine to generate relevance scores.
The development involves multiple stages, starting with a basic Python script interacting with
the OpenAI API, progressing to a Flask-based web interface, and ultimately deploying the
application on the Google Cloud Platform.
The project explores the challenges and solutions encountered during each phase, including
system architecture, implementation methodologies, testing procedures, and the utilization of
Agile practices. Through unit testing and stress testing, the project evaluates the application's
robustness and identifies potential areas for improvement. The implementation journey
showcases the evolution of the project from a simple script to a fully-fledged web application
accessible on the cloud.
The system's architectural design involves layers of components, and the application's
deployment on Google Cloud signifies scalability and accessibility. The documentation provides
a comprehensive overview of the project's scope, requirements, analysis, and use cases.
Additionally, the project highlights the significance of stress testing in identifying system
limitations under heavy user load.
In conclusion, the "Relevance Checker" project offers insights into the integration of OpenAI's
GPT API, the development of a user interface, and the deployment of a web application on a
cloud platform. The iterative development process, testing methodologies, and system
architecture contribute to the project's success, laying the foundation for future enhancements
and optimizations.
